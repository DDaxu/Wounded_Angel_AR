Hey!

This is my and mine friend's school project and it is about exploring church using AR.

This AR application have 5 different painting which have additional information in AR.

What you need to run this application in unity:
Unity version 2018.4.14f1 or similar from the same year.
Unity vuforia installed (You can install or add it in unity hub)
Web-camera

To test this application you need to do following:

1. Clone the project to your computer and start it with Unity version 2018 and something (otherwise Vuforia won't work)
2.Pick a scene Ohjattu or Vapaa (They are the same, but Ohjattu is the demo we were focusing on)
3. There is ARcamera object in hierarchy, open it in inspector and click "Open vuforia Engine Configuration"
  3.1 Under webcam there is Camera device, change it to your webcam if you have two of them. Otherwise webcamera is the one which you already have. For example
      if you're using laptop there are laptops webcam and the possible external one.
4.Under game window, change resolution to 1280x720 potrait. Otherwise the UI won't scale
5. Test pictures are here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FG8RbpqbOuNGkMfBCY8rD54iVlZ799nT?usp=sharing
  5.1 If you're in Ohjattu scene, Go through pictures from 1-5
  5.2 If you're in Vapaa scene, you can look all pictures in any order you want.
  
  
Have fun with my demo!
